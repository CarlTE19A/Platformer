Every map will have a personal file
In each file there will be:

"file"/checkpoint.txt
"file"/platform.txt

Each object should be made by the form
X, Y, Width, Height
Note. Keep width and Height worth positivet

Ex.
100, 200, 300, 30
200, 100, 300, 30

The first checkpoint should be the starting point
